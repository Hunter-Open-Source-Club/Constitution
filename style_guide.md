Documents in this repo are written in `pandoc`-flavored markdown

# Common

1. ordered list
1. next element of list
   a. sub-element of list
   
Following coding convention to facilitate viewing in terminals, lines in
paragraphs should be broken after no more than 79 characters and no fewer than
65. Find a plugin for your editor that does this.

# Program Names

You can stylize a program's as `program_name` where appropriate. As a rule of
thumb, this should happen for small and large programs, but not trademarked
names. 

# Pandoc-specific

to refer to another section in the document, use `*[name of section]*` as in
*[Program Names]*, which links to the section with that label.
