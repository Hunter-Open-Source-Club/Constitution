# Constitution

## Article Z Definitions

For the purposes of this document and unless the distinction is specified
explicitly, let the term Open Source include both permissive (copy-center) and
reciprocal (copy-left) licenses.

Let Open Source refer to Creative Commons Licenses and other permissive licenses
when referring to educational documents such as instructional textbooks.

## Article I Name

The name of this organization will be Hunter's **Open Source Club** or **OSC**.

The Hunter **Association for the Advancement of Free, Libre, and Open Source
Software** was suggested, but discarded because of its verbosity. Before it,
Hunter's **Free Software Club** was suggested, but discarded because it is not
inclusive of permissive licenses, and suffers from the ambiguity: free might be
misinterpreted to be free of charge instead of software **free**dom.

\marginpar{To not stray far from the topic, this distinction is clarified in *Article IX Ideology*.}

## Article II Purpose

executive board as defined by Hunter's Club requirements.

*In this article you should include sections: 1) Listing of officers, 2)
Describe the method of nomination and election of officers, 3) Describe the
duties of the elected officers. 4) Describe how officers may be
removed/impeached.*

### Duties

The president must honor petitions and call a vote.

### Impeachment

The president may be impeached for not fulfilling presidential duties.

## Article V Committees

As an Open Source community, it is important for us to collaborate with our members and the general Hunter College student/faculty base, especially in an organized and productive fashion. Therefore, we have defined three committees, each division responsible for certain tasks. These committees and their responsibilities are listed below.

**1. Public Outreach**
   * Maintain the Open Source Club website, with duties including (but not limited to) developing new sections/pages, and updating the site with new information
   * Manage the mailing list and related technologies; formulate and send out emails
   * Manage the club's social media presence and accounts
   * Design visual and/or auditory content representative of the club (e.g. logos, flyers, posters, promotional/infomational videos
   * Document relavant workshops/presentations in the form of videos or blogs (or other) and publish them online
   * Reach out to established computer scientists (or other) to come speak/collaborate with the club
   
**2. Career Preparation**
   * Host events for non-technical students introducing them to programming
   * Host events on practical topics which may not be represented in the Computer Science curriculum, such as web development
   * Lead workshops on small projects

**3. Academic and Conceptual**
   * Establish position of Grade Level Learners (GLL), students who do their assignments ahead of schedule and
      1. reach out to professors to fix any problems with the assignments or autograders
      2. use their expertise to help fellow students
      3. gather and post online resources to help with assignments
   * Host presentations, "talks", or other events sharing educational material (which need not necessarily be practical, but can instead be conceptual or simply cool)
   * Propogate the ideals of the Open Source and/or Free software movements

New committees may be created, existing committees may be dissolved, and responsibilities may be added, removed, or adjusted for any committee by following the Standard Legislative Process (SLP) defined in Article VII Quorum. These changes should be appended to the constitution by following the procedure specified in Article VIII Amendment.
   

### Elections

Elections are held once yearly.
*This article may merely describe the method of elections or appointing any
committees; or, it may list specific standing committees, their membership, and
purpose.*

## Article VI Meetings
*This article should state the method for scheduling regular meeting days and
hours, and for calling special meetings.*

## Article VII Quorum


| Standard        | Portion    |
|-----------------|------------|
| Mere-Minority   | $\leq$ 25% |
| Strict-Majority | > 50%      |
| Super-Majority  | $\geq$ 75% |
:  Table of Standards

The Open Source world thrives in part because of its lack of hierarchy. The
following is an attempt to redirect power into the hands of the constituency to
adhere more closely to ideological roots.

### Standard Legislative Process

The *Standard Legislative Process (SLP)* is the usual method for creating and
enacting new rules. Let SLP consist of one or more of the following actions:

1. Top-down Standard
   a. A member of the executive board takes a tentative action,
   a. that action is immediately called upon for approval through vote, and
   a. no more than a Mere-Minority of the club's voting members object to the
   law.
   
1. Bottom-up Standard
   a. A club member begins a petition,
   a. that petition gets 10 signatures, or 10 percent of the constituency,
   whichever amount is larger, and
   a. more than  of the club's voting members approve it.
   
*SLP* always requires an extra step of approval. 

### Popular Democratic Action

Unlike *SLP *Popular democratic action is final. Super-majority is the standard
for this vote.

### Vote

Each member gets one vote, including members of the Executive Board. 

Each voting period will last one week or until the standard is met.


## Article VIII Amendment
*This article should describe the procedure for proposing and voting upon
amendments to the constitution.*

## Article IX Ideology

### Preamble

It is quite possible that much of our intended audience is not familiar with the
concept of "Open Source." That won't be an issue, however, as the very nature of
the culture propogated by the Open Source movement is defined by inclusivity,
freedom, and respect. All are welcome, and all will learn in due time.

### Definition

Literally interpreted, the term 'Open Source' is relatively self explanatory -- it is an adjective used to describe code which is available for view and use by anybody. Proponents of Open Source are drawn to it for a multitude of reasons, whether due to its inherent practicality (*"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"*), or its imperative of fostering [epistemic justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_injustice). 

### History
Though originally [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#History), once software left the realm of academia and [hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) it didn't take long for it to become a proprietary commodity. The resurgence of freedom and openness in software can be likened to the Enlightenment -- a period of time which followed the Dark ages, which, in turn, were preceded by the intellectualism of the ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Many great people have been involved in promoting these ideals -- we stand on the shoulders of giants, ordinary heroes. The history of Computer Science and Open Source is the people's history, and [there is much to be learned from those who preceded us](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HegHis). It is left as an exercise to the reader to discover some of the many colorful characters -- and those that leave a stain on the Open Source movement. Although Open Source has its fair share of negative figures, we must take that as an opportunity to learn and grow together as a community.
