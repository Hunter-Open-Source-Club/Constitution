# Constitution

## Article Z Definitions

For the purposes of this document and unless the distinction is specified
explicitly, let the term Open Source include both permissive (copy-center) and
reciprocal (copy-left) licenses.

Let Open Source refer to Creative Commons family of licenses and other
permissive and copy-left licenses
when referring to educational documents such as instructional textbooks.

Standard Legislative Process and Popular Referendum are terms defined in
[Article VII Quorum].

## Article I Name

The name of this organization will be Hunter's **Open Source Club** or **OSC**.


The Hunter **Association for the Advancement of Free, Libre, and Open Source
Software** was suggested, but ultimately discarded because of its verbosity.
\marginpar{To not stray far from the topic, this distinction is clarified in
Article IX Ideology.}
Before it, Hunter's **Free Software Club** was suggested, but discarded because
it is not inclusive of permissive licenses, and suffers from the ambiguity: free
might be misinterpreted to be free of charge instead of software **free**dom.

## Article II Purpose

### Ends

The club's primary goals are to...

1. combat elitism, increase equitability and promote accessibility in computer
   coding and programming,
   
1. bolster student portfolios and prepare students for a future in computer

## Article IV Officers

Let the words *Executive Board* and *Officers* refer to the members of the
executive board as defined by Hunter's Club requirements.

Filling any vacancies is subject to *Standard Legislative Process*. Vacancies of
officers other than the president are filled by presidential appointment.

### Impeachment

Any Officer may be impeached by vote for not fulfilling duties, or for extended
unannounced absence, or may be impeached automatically following disciplinary
action by Hunter College.

### President

The President may be understood as a trusted mentor or advisor, taking the
popular action to accelerate progress when consensus is clear. The president
must honor referendum and call a vote. The president is culpable for all of
those responsibilities as outlined in Hunter College's Club Regulations.

The president is responsible for any additional actions needed to ensure the
club's healthy function. A president automatically resigns after a week of
unannounced absence during the normal semester.

### Vice President

The Vice President assumes the role of the President and appoints a new Vice
President in the case of vacancies.

..
### Secretary

The Secretary's primary role is to confer with the executive board, organize
meetings, and maintain strong communication between officers and the membership.
These roles lend well to leadership of the Outreach committee.


## Article V Committees

As an Open Source community, it is important for us to collaborate with our
members and the general Hunter College student/faculty base, especially in an
organized and productive fashion. Therefore, we have defined three committees,
each division responsible for certain tasks. These types of committees and their
responsibilities are listed below.

1. Public Outreach Committee

   * Maintain the Open Source Club website, with duties including (but not
     limited to) developing new sections/pages, and updating the site with new
     information.

   * Manage the mailing list and related technologies; formulate and send out
     emails.

   * Manage the club's social media presence and accounts.

   * Design visual and/or auditory content representative of the club (e.g.
     logos, flyers, posters, promotional/infomational videos.

   * Document relevant workshops/presentations in the form of videos or blogs
     (or other) and publish them online.

   * Reach out to established industry leaders for club collaboration.
   
2. Career Preparation Committee

   * Host events for non-technical students introducing them to programming

   * Host events on practical topics which may not be represented in the
     Computer Science curriculum, such as web development

   * Lead workshops on small projects

3. Academic and Ideological Committee

   * Establish position of Grade Level Leaders (GLL), students who do their
     assignments ahead of schedule and

      1. reach out to professors to fix any problems with the assignments or
         auto-graders

      2. use their expertise to help fellow students

      3. gather and post online resources to help with assignments to post on
         the Open Source Club website

   * Host presentations, "talks", or other events sharing educational material
     (which need not necessarily be technical, but can instead be conceptual or
     simply interesting to draw in beginners)

   * Propogate the ideals of the Open Source movements

New committees may be created, existing committees may be dissolved, and
responsibilities may be added, removed, or adjusted for any committee by
following the Standard Legislative Process (SLP) defined in [Article VII
Quorum]. These changes should be appended to the constitution by following the
procedure specified in Article VIII.
   
### Elections

Elections are a vote held once yearly and according to Hunter College club
regulations. Committee members are appointed by Standard Legislative Process.

## Article VI Meetings

Meetings are scheduled by Standard Legislative Process. Special meetings are
called in the case of Popular Referendum. 

## Article VII Quorum

### Vote

Each member gets one vote, including members of the Executive Board. 

Each voting period will last one week or until the standard is met. Quorum
should be 80 percent of all members. Officers will maximize accessibility by
providing a secure, online option for voting.

| Standard        | Portion    |
|-----------------|------------|
| Mere-Minority   | $\leq$ 25% |
| Strict-Majority | > 50%      |
| Super-Majority  | $\geq$ 75% |
:  Table of Standards

The Open Source world thrives in part because of its lack of hierarchy. The
following is an attempt to redirect power into the hands of the constituency to
adhere more closely to ideological roots.

### Standard Legislative Process

The *Standard Legislative Process (SLP)* is the usual method for creating and
enacting new rules. Let SLP consist of one or more of the following actions:

1. Top-down Proceeding

   a. A member of the executive board takes a tentative action,

   a. that action is immediately called upon for approval through vote, and

   a. no more than a Mere-Minority of the club's quorum object to the
   law.
   
1. Bottom-up Proceeding

   a. A club member begins a petition,

   a. that petition gets 10 signatures, or 10 percent of the quorum,
   whichever amount is larger, and

   a. at least a Strict-Majority of the club's quorum approve it.
   
*SLP* always requires an extra step of approval. In the Top-down proceeding, 75
percent of quorum tacitly approve the Top-down action by inaction. In the
Bottom-up proceeding, approval is explicit.

### Popular Referendum

Unlike *SLP*, *Popular Referendum* is final. First, any more than a
Strict-Minority may call for a vote. A Super-Majority is then needed to approve
the vote. .

## Article VIII Amendment

Ammendments to the con
*This article should describe the procedure for proposing and voting upon
amendments to the constitution.*

## Article IX Ideology

### Preamble

It is quite possible that much of our intended audience is not familiar with the
concept of "Open Source." That won't be an issue, however, as the very nature of
the culture propogated by the Open Source movement is defined by inclusivity,
freedom, and respect. All are welcome, and all will learn in due time.

### Definition

Literally interpreted, the term 'Open Source' is relatively self explanatory --
it is an adjective used to describe code which is available for view and use by
anybody. Proponents of Open Source are drawn to it for a multitude of reasons,
whether due to its inherent practicality (*"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are
shallow"*), or its imperative of fostering [epistemic
justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_injustice).

### History
Though originally [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#History),
once software left the realm of academia and
[hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) it didn't take long for
it to become a proprietary commodity. The resurgence of freedom and openness in
software can be likened to the Enlightenment -- a period of time which followed
the Dark Ages, which, in turn, were preceded by the intellectualism of the
ancient Greek and Roman Empires. These movements share more than similarly 
structured histories -- many of the ideals put forward by the Free and Open Source 
movements (such as the belief that knowledge should be free) originated in the 
Enlightenment. Many great people have been involved in
promoting these ideals -- we stand on the shoulders of giants, ordinary heroes.
The history of Computer Science and Open Source is the people's history, and
[there is much to be learned from those who preceded
us](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HegHis).

It is left as an exercise to the reader to discover some of the many colorful
characters -- and those that leave a stain on the Open Source movement. Although
Open Source has its fair share of negative figures, we must take that as an
opportunity to learn and grow together as a community.
