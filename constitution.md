# Constitution

## Definitions

For the purposes of this document and unless the distinction is specified
explicitly, let the term Open Source include both permissive (copy center) and
reciprocal (copy left) licenses.

Let Open Source refer to Creative Commons Licenses and other permissive licenses
when referring to educational documents such as instructional textbooks.

## Article I Name

The name of this organization will be Hunter's **Open Source Club** or **OSC**.

The Hunter **Association for the Advancement of Free, Libre, and Open Source
Software** was suggested, but discarded because of its verbosity. Before it,
Hunter's **Free Software Club** was suggested, but discarded because it is not
inclusive of permissive licenses, and suffers from the ambiguity: free might be
misinterpreted to be free of charge instead of software **free**dom.

   students can learn about physical computing and computer hardware in a
   welcoming environment.
1. Reach out to Hunter Professors, offer, and undertake the creation,
   deployment, and maintenance of Open Source
   1. class materials,
   1. class websites, and
   1. solutions to classroom problems or inefficiencies *sui generis*.

## Article IX Ideology

### Preamble

It is quite possible that much of our intended audience is not familiar with the
concept of "Open Source". That won't be an issue, however, as the very nature of
the culture propogated by the Open Source movement is defined by inclusivity,
freedom, and respect. All are welcome, and all will learn in due time.

### Definition

Literally interpreted, the term 'Open Source' is relatively self explanatory --
it is an adjective used to describe code which is available for view and use by
anybody (code written by programmers is known as *source code*, which
explains why the word *source* is included). Proponents of Open Source are drawn
to it for a multitude of reasons, whether due to its inherent practicality
(*"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"*), or from the point of view of
social justice, as the Open Source community tends to be especially welcoming of
those who have been historically marginalized.

### History

Many great people have been involved in the creation of such a radical movement
(yes, at the time of its inception the majority of businesses viewed software as
something inherently proprietary). The history of computer science in general is
very rich and dense, full of intriguing characters and lore -- the Open Source
movement is no exception. The immediate ancestor of Open Source, namely Free
Software, was a concept pioneered by the one and only Richard Stallman.

 Stallman's "Free Software" was "free as in speech." It differs from Open Souce   s
