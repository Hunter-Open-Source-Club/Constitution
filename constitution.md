# Constitution

## Article Z Definitions

For the purposes of this document and unless the distinction is specified
explicitly, let the term Open Source include both permissive (copy-center) and
reciprocal (copy-left) licenses.

Let Open Source refer to Creative Commons Licenses and other permissive licenses
when referring to educational documents such as instructional textbooks.

## Article I Name

The name of this organization will be Hunter's **Open Source Club** or **OSC**.

The Hunter **Association for the Advancement of Free, Libre, and Open Source
Software** was suggested, but ultimately discarded because of its verbosity.
Before it, Hunter's **Free Software Club** was suggested, but discarded because
it is not inclusive of permissive licenses, and suffers from the ambiguity: free
might be misinterpreted to be free of charge instead of software **free**dom.

\marginpar{To not stray far from the topic, this distinction is clarified in
Article IX Ideology.}

## Article II Purpose

### Inspiration

This club was founded with inspiration from Professor Stewart Weiss, who
teaches *Open Source Development Workshop* and encouraged the chartering
process.

## Article VII Quorum


| Standard        | Portion    |

| Strict-Majority | > 50%      |
| Super-Majority  | $\geq$ 75% |
:  Table of Standards

The Open Source world thrives in part because of its lack of hierarchy. The
following is an attempt to redirect power into the hands of the constituency to
adhere more closely to ideological roots.

### Standard Legislative Process

The *Standard Legislative Process (SLP)* is the usual method for creating and
enacting new rules. Let SLP consist of one or more of the following actions:

1. Top-down Standard
   a. A member of the executive board takes a tentative action,
   a. that action is immediately called upon for approval through vote, and
   a. no more than a Mere-Minority of the club's voting members object to the
   law.
   
1. Bottom-up Standard
   a. A club member begins a petition,
   a. that petition gets 10 signatures, or 10 percent of the constituency,
   whichever amount is larger, and
   a. at least a Strict-Majority of the club's voting members approve it.
   
*SLP* always requires an extra step of approval. 

### Popular Democratic Action

Unlike *SLP *Popular democratic action is final. Super-majority is the standard
for this vote.

### Vote

Each member gets one vote, including members of the Executive Board. 

Each voting period will last one week or until the standard is met.


## Article VIII Amendment
*This article should describe the procedure for proposing and voting upon
amendments to the constitution.*

## Article IX Ideology

### Preamble

It is quite possible that much of our intended audience is not familiar with the
concept of "Open Source." That won't be an issue, however, as the very nature of
the culture propogated by the Open Source movement is defined by inclusivity,
freedom, and respect. All are welcome, and all will learn in due time.

### Definition

Literally interpreted, the term 'Open Source' is relatively self explanatory --
it is an adjective used to describe code which is available for view and use by
anybody (code written by programmers is known as *source code*, which
explains why the word *source* is included). Proponents of Open Source are drawn
to it for a multitude of reasons, whether due to its inherent practicality
(*"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"*), or from the point of view of
social justice, as the Open Source community tends to be especially welcoming of
those who have been historically marginalized.

### History

Many great people have been involved in the creation of such a radical movement
(yes, at the time of its inception the majority of businesses viewed software as
something inherently proprietary). The history of computer science in general is
very rich and dense, full of intriguing characters and lore -- the Open Source
movement is no exception.

It is left as an exercise to the reader to discover some of the many colorful
characters -- and those that leave a stain on the Open Source movement. Although
Open Source has its fair share of negative figures, we must take that as an
opportunity to learn and grow together as a community.
