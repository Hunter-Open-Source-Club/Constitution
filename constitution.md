# Constitution

## Article Z Definitions

For the purposes of this document and unless the distinction is specified
explicitly, let the term Open Source include both permissive (copy center) and
reciprocal (copy left) licenses.

Let Open Source refer to Creative Commons Licenses and other permissive licenses
when referring to educational documents such as instructional textbooks.

## Article I Name

The name of this organization will be Hunter's **Open Source Club** or **OSC**.

The Hunter **Association for the Advancement of Free, Libre, and Open Source
Software** was suggested, but discarded because of its verbosity. Before it,
Hunter's **Free Software Club** was suggested, but discarded because it is not
inclusive of permissive licenses, and suffers from the ambiguity: free might be
misinterpreted to be free of charge instead of software **free**dom.

## Article IX Ideology

### Preamble

It is quite possible that much of our intended audience is not familiar with the concept of "Open Source". That won't be an issue, however, as the very nature of the culture inherent to the Open Source movement is defined by inclusivity, freedom, and respect. All are welcome, and all will learn in due time.

### Definition

Literally interpreted, the term 'Open Source' is relatively self explanatory -- it is an adjective used to describe code which is available for view and use by anybody. Proponents of Open Source are drawn to it for a multitude of reasons, whether due to its inherent practicality (*"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"*), or its imperative of fostering [epistemic justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_injustice). 

### History
Though originally [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#History), once software left the realm of academia and [hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) it didn't take long for it to become a proprietary commodity. The resurgence of freedom and openness in software can be likened to the Enlightenment -- a period of time which followed the Dark ages, which, in turn, were preceded by the intellectualism of the ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Many great people have been involved in promoting these ideals -- we stand on the shoulders of giants, ordinary heroes. The history of Computer Science and Open Source is the people's history, and [there is much to be learned from those who preceded us](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HegHis). It is left as an exercise to the reader to dig further into the culture of Free and Open Source software, you may want to start by looking [here](https://www.fsf.org) and [here](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/).
