# Constitution

## Article Z Definitions

For the purposes of this document and unless the distinction is specified
explicitly, let the term Open Source include both permissive (copy center) and
reciprocal (copy left) licenses.

Let Open Source refer to Creative Commons Licenses and other permissive licenses
when referring to educational documents such as instructional textbooks.

## Article I Name

The name of this organization will be Hunter's **Open Source Club** or **OSC**.

The Hunter **Association for the Advancement of Free, Libre, and Open Source
Software** was suggested, but discarded because of its verbosity. Before it,
Hunter's **Free Software Club** was suggested, but discarded because it is not
inclusive of permissive licenses, and suffers from the ambiguity: free might be
misinterpreted to be free of charge instead of software **free**dom.

## Article II Purpose

### Ends

The club's primary goals are to...

1. combat elitism, increase equitablility and promote accessibility in computer
   coding and programming,
1. bolster student portfolios and prepare students for a future in computer
   science, and
1. improve adoption of Open Source Software among technical students, professors
   and creatives.

### Means

To acheive these goals, the club will...

1. provide technical assistance for computer science and math classes for
   members and,
1. host technical and behavioral workshops to advance career readiness for
   members, and
1. build, deploy, and promote Open Source Software and solutions for all target
   groups.

### Allied Goals

1. Maintain a strong presence on social media and in physical advertising to
   allow all Hunter students to benefit from club opportunities.
1. Build, deploy, and maintain an Open Source Club website serving as a central
   hub for resources on and off the campus.
1. Lobby for and consolidate tools for the creation of a makerspace where
   students can learn about physical computing and computer hardware in a
   welcoming environment.
1. Reach out to Hunter Professors, offer, and undertake the creation,
   deployment, and maintenance of Open Source
   1. class materials,
   1. class websites, and
   1. solutions to classroom problems or inefficiencies *sui generis*.

## Article III Membership
 
1. Membership is granted to any person in the Hunter College Community,
   regardless of sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, or
   disability.
1. Voting membership is granted to all members.
1. All members should make an effort to participate in the community and commit
   to sharing knowledge for the betterment of the community.
1. Voting membership will be suspended in the case of
  1. a vote equal to or exceeding two-thirds of voting members, or

## Article IV Officers
*In this article you should include sections: 1) Listing of officers, 2)
Describe the method of nomination and election of officers, 3) Describe the
duties of the elected officers. 4) Describe how officers may be
removed/impeached.*

## Article V Committees
As an Open Source community, it is important for us to collaborate with our members and the general Hunter College student/faculty base, especially in an organized and productive fashion. Therefore, we have defined three committees, each division responsible for certain tasks. These committees and their responsibilities are listed below.

**1. Public Outreach**
   * Maintain the Open Source Club website, with duties including (but not limited to) developing new sections/pages, and updating the site with new information
   * Manage the mailing list and related technologies; formulate and send out emails
   * Manage the club's social media presence and accounts
   * Design visual and/or auditory content representative of the club (e.g. logos, flyers, posters, promotional/infomational videos
   * Document relavant workshops/presentations in the form of videos or blogs (or other) and publish them online
   * Reach out to established computer scientists (or other) to come speak/collaborate with the club
   
**2. Career Preparation**
   * Host events for non-technical students introducing them to programming
   * Host events on practical topics which may not be represented in the Computer Science curriculum, such as web development
   * Lead workshops on small projects

**3. Academic and Conceptual**
   * Establish position of Grade Level Learners (GLL), students who do their assignments ahead of schedule and
      1. reach out to professors to fix any problems with the assignments or autograders
      2. use their expertise to help fellow students
      3. gather and post online resources to help with assignments
   * Host presentations, "talks", or other events sharing educational material (which need not necessarily be practical, but can instead be conceptual or simply cool)
   * Propogate the ideals of the Open Source and/or Free software movements

New committees may be created, existing committees may be dissolved, and responsibilities may be added, removed, or adjusted for any committee by following $PROCESS. These changes should be appended to the constitution by following the procedure specified in Article VIII Amendment.
   
## Article VI Meetings
*This article should state the method for scheduling regular meeting days and
hours, and for calling special meetings.*

## Article VII Quorum
*This article should state the portion of the membership necessary to constitute
a quorum.*

## Article VIII Amendment
*This article should describe the procedure for proposing and voting upon
amendments to the constitution.*

## Article IX Ideology

### Preamble

It is quite possible that much of our intended audience is not familiar with the concept of "Open Source". That won't be an issue, however, as the very nature of the culture inherent to the Open Source movement is defined by inclusivity, freedom, and respect. All are welcome, and all will learn in due time.

### Definition

Literally interpreted, the term 'Open Source' is relatively self explanatory -- it is an adjective used to describe code which is available for view and use by anybody. Proponents of Open Source are drawn to it for a multitude of reasons, whether due to its inherent practicality (*"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"*), or its imperative of fostering [epistemic justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_injustice). 

### History
Though originally [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#History), once software left the realm of academia and [hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) it didn't take long for it to become a proprietary commodity. The resurgence of freedom and openness in software can be likened to the Enlightenment -- a period of time which followed the Dark ages, which, in turn, were preceded by the intellectualism of the ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Many great people have been involved in promoting these ideals -- we stand on the shoulders of giants, ordinary heroes. The history of Computer Science and Open Source is the people's history, and [there is much to be learned from those who preceded us](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HegHis). It is left as an exercise to the reader to discover some of the many colorful characters -- and those that leave a stain on the Open Source movement. Although Open Source has its fair share of negative figures, we must take that as an opportunity to learn and grow together as a community.
